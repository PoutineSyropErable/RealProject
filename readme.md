This go git filter repo nuked.
I send them a issue because why would an commit history modifying command nuke a repo when theres a typo or you type a file name that doesnt exist. 

It should say file doesnt exist. Not delete everything in .git and (~.git) being a fancier rm -rf that might leave a few file if it feels like it. 

So, all big file will be sent to a shared google drive. 
You'll find the weighs there.
