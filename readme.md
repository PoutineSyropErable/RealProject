All important files are on ./main 

They are named in the order that you'd use them. 
There's even a bash file that runs everything for you.

I need to do tomorrow
13_incremental_train_model.py
14_use_model_for_calculation.py # Optional
15_recreate_mesh_from_model.py  # Optional
16_physics_simulation_from_model.py # Takes Finger position and shows the physics animation deformation
17_calculate_model_errors.py    # Would be nice for scientific purposes, but there's no time I'll time to do that one. 
// Just the run time itself will take too long.
